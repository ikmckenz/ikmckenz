I am very happy to announce that the University of Calgary team won first place at the [RITC 2018][ritc-main] competition! 
We all worked incredibly hard and I am so happy that the work paid off.
Overall, we got top 5 in each of the different cases. This is the first time any school has achieved that result.
Some of the schools we beat include Carnegie Mellon's MSCF program, Baruch College from CUNY, Cambridge University, and many other very smart groups of people.
I was personally responsible for the algorithmic trading case and I came in fourth place. 
This was a fantastic learning experience for me and I am very grateful for it.
